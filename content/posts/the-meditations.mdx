Favorite quotes from the book:

> You have power over your mind - not outside events. Realize this, and you will find strength.

> The happiness of your life depends upon the quality of your thoughts.

> Everything we hear is an opinion, not a fact. Everything we see is a perspective, not the truth.

> Waste no more time arguing about what a good man should be. Be one.

> You could leave life right now. Let that determine what you do and say and think.

> People try to get away from it all â€” to the country, to the beach, to the mountains. You always wish that you could too. Which is idiotic: you can get away from it anytime you like. By going within.

> He never exhibited rudeness, lost control of himself, or turned violent. No one ever saw him sweat. Everything was to be approached logically and with due consideration, in a calm and orderly fashion but decisively, and with no loose ends.

> So many who were remembered already forgotten, and those who remembered them long gone.
