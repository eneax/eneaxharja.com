Objects are JavaScript values that can be used to group related data. You can create an object by writing `{}`:

```js
let mario = {};
```

Here is the `mario` variable pointing to an object value. Let's add some facts about Mario to the object:

```js
let mario = {
  name: "Mario",
  species: "Human",
  occupation: "Plumber",
  origin: "Mushroom Kingdom",
};
```

From the above example, you can see that the variable `mario` points to an object we created. Such an object has four properties:

- the `name` property points to the string value `"Mario"`,
- the `species` property points to the string value `"Human"`,
- the `occupation` property points to the string value `"Plumber"`,
- the `origin` property points to the string value `"Mushroom Kingdom"`.

Both variables and properties can be thought of as wires. Unlike variables, however, property wires start from objects and not from your code. In fact, properties belong to a particular object and point to values, rather than containing them.

Property names have the following features:

1. They are case sensitive. For example, `name` and `Name` would be two completely different properties.
2. A single object cannot have two properties with the same name. For example, our object cannot have two properties named `occupation`.
3. If you do not know in advance the name of a property, which exists in the code as a string value, you can use the bracket notation `[]` to read it from an object.

## Assigning a value to a property

You can also assign a new value to an existing property:

```js
mario.occupation = "Athlete";
```

You can divide the above code into two parts separated by `=`: the left part (wire) and the right part (value). First, you follow the `mario` wire, which leads to an object. From this object, you follow the `occupation` property. For now, you are not interested in its current value.

Unlike the left side, the right side of an assignment always expresses a value. In this example, the value of the right side is the string value `"Athlete"`, which you can summon.

Finally, it is time to perform the assignment, pointing the wire on the left side to the value on the right side. From now on, reading `mario.occupation` will result in `"Athlete"`.

## Missing Properties

You can read the current value of a property using the "dot notation" syntax:

```js
console.log(mario.name); // "Mario"
```

Here, `mario.name` is an expression, a question to JavaScript. To answer it, JavaScript first follows the `mario` wire, which eventually leads to an object. From this object, JavaScript follows the `name` property, which points to the number value `"Mario"`. Thus, `mario.name` results in `"Mario"`.

What happens if you read a property that does not exist:

```js
console.log(mario.family);
```

JavaScript calculates an expression such as `object.property` in three steps:

1. It locates the value to the left of the dot (`.`).
2. If that value is `null` or `undefined`, it throws an error.
3. It checks whether a property with that name exists in the object:
   a. If it exists, the result is the value to which this property points.
   b. If it does not exist, the result is `undefined`.

For example, `mario` points to an object that does not have a `family` property. So `mario.family` gives `undefined` as an answer. This does not mean that the object has a `family` property that points to `undefined`. It has only two properties and neither of them is named `family`.

Using the same rules, let's try to read a property of a property:

```js
let mario = {
  name: "Mario",
  origin: "Mushroom Kingdom",
};

console.log(mario.family); // undefined
console.log(mario.family.brother); // TypeError
```

In this case, there are two dots, so you need to follow the rules twice. First, it is necessary to find the value of `mario.family`. To do this, you need to find the value of `mario`. The variable `mario` points to an object. Therefore, the value of `mario` is that object. An object is not `null` or `undefined`, so it is continued. This object does not have a `family` property. Therefore, the value of `mario.family` is `undefined`.

Now, there is `undefined` on the left side of the dot (`.`). The rules say that `null` or `undefined` on the left side is an error. So, you throw an error.

Basically, it is because every expression must result in a value or throw an error.
