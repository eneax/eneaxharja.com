George Orwell offers his vision of a totalitarian, bureaucratic government that will do anything to control the lives of every individual.

Favorite quotes from the book:

> “Perhaps one did not want to be loved so much as to be understood.”

> “Who controls the past controls the future. Who controls the present controls the past.”
