W. Chan Kim presents a systematic approach to making the competition irrelevant by overturning traditional thinking about strategy.

Favorite quote from the book:

> “Value innovation is the cornerstone of blue ocean strategy. We call it value innovation because instead of focusing on beating the competition, you focus on making the competition irrelevant by creating a leap in value for buyers and your company, thereby opening up new and uncontested market space.”
