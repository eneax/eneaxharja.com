The dice game Pig is considered a "jeopardy game", where you risk all your points to see if you can win more. The numbers on the die, except for "1", represent points that the player can accumulate.

### Gameplay

Each turn, a player repeatedly rolls a die until either a "1" is rolled or the player decides to "hold":

If the player rolls a "1", he/she scores nothing and it becomes the next player's turn.
If the player rolls any other number, it is added to his/her turn total score and the player's turn continues.
If a player chooses to "hold", his/her turn total score is added to the global score, and it becomes the next player's turn.
The first player to score 100 or more points wins.
