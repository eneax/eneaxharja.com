Favorite quotes from the [book](https://amzn.eu/47PPyik):

> Peace, though beloved of our Lord, is a cardinal virtue only if your neighbours share your conscience.

> If people praise you, you're not walking your own path.

> Anything is true if enough people believe it is.

> ... my dreams are the single unpredictable factor in my zoned days and nights. Nobody allots them, or censors them. Dreams are all I have ever truly owned.

> What was all this knowledge for, I would ask myself, if I could not use it to better my existence?

> Time is what stops history happening at once; time is the speed at which the past disappears.

> My life amounts to no more than one drop in a limitless ocean. Yet what is any ocean, but a multitude of drops?

> You say you're "depressed" - all I see is resilience. You are allowed to feel messed up and inside out. It doesn't mean you're defective - it just means you're human.
