The Machine Stops (Nov 1909) is a science fiction short story, where Forster predicts new technologies such as instant messaging and the internet.

Favorite quotes from the book:

> “You talk as if a god had made the Machine," cried the other. "I believe that you pray to it when you are unhappy. Men made it, do not forget that. Great men, but men. The Machine is much, but not everything.”
