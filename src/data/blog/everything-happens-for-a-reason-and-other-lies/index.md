In her memoir, Kate Bowler boldly articulates the pain she feels as she contemplates her own mortality.

Favorite quotes from the [book](https://amzn.eu/5mTWUBO):

> “Life is a series of losses," says my father-in-law one afternoon...."What Dad?"..."oh, I was just thinking about how, with age, it is one loss after another, " he replies. "Huh." He is right. With age we slowly lose our senses and even our pleasures, our parents and then our friends, preparing us for our own absence. An interesting thought.”

> “Don’t skip to the end,” he said, gently. “Don’t skip to the end.”
