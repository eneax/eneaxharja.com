Adam Grant addresses the challenge of improving the world from the perspective of becoming original and choosing to value ideas that battle conformity and outdated traditions.

Favorite quotes from the [book](http://a.co/5ugr6Gq):

> “In the deepest sense of the word, a friend is someone who sees more potential in you than you see in yourself, someone who helps you become the best version of yourself.”

> “Argue like you’re right and listen like you’re wrong.”
