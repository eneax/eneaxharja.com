Robert Heinlein tells a tale of revolution, of the rebellion of a former penal colony on the Moon against its masters on the Earth.

Favorite quotes from the book:

> “There is no worse tyranny than to force a man to pay for what he does not want merely because you think it would be good for him.”

> “Don't explain computers to laymen. Simpler to explain sex to a virgin.”

> “I will accept any rules that you feel necessary to your freedom. I am free, no matter what rules surround me. If I find them tolerable, I tolerate them; if I find them too obnoxious, I break them. I am free because I know that I alone am morally responsible for everything I do.”
