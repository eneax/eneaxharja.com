Tara Westover's story is the perfect example of what an education is and what it offers: the perspective to see one's life through new eyes and the will to change it.

Favorite quotes from the [book](https://amzn.eu/frCEeLg):

> “You can love someone and still choose to say goodbye to them,” she says now. “You can miss a person every day, and still be glad that they are no longer in your life.”

> “My life was narrated for me by others. Their voices were forceful, emphatic, absolute. It had never occurred to me that my voice might be as strong as theirs.”

> “The thing about having a mental breakdown is that no matter how obvious it is that you're having one, it is somehow not obvious to you. I'm fine, you think. So what if I watched TV for twenty-four straight hours yesterday. I'm not falling apart. I'm just lazy. Why it's better to think yourself lazy than think yourself in distress, I'm not sure. But it was better. More than better: it was vital.”

> “It’s strange how you give the people you love so much power over you.”
