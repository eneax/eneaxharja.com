Iâ€™ve been reading blogs for quite some time now, and thought about starting one many times. But who starts a blog in the Age of Social Media?

Do you have something quick to say, maybe less or equal to 280 characters? Twitter is the place for you. Do you feel like you have so much to say that you would probably write a whole manifesto? Then Facebook is your place. Or maybe you don't like writing and instead, prefer to talk and enjoy being in front of a camera. YouTube or Instagram are yours to conquer.

There are plenty of choices, many services to choose from and each of them with their unique features, but all of them with one thing in common: they all need attention.

I believe the most important resource I have at disposal is time, which is directly related to the people and things I pay attention to. The way I use my time determines who I am and who I will become.

So instead of spending my time mindlessly browsing the Internet, I decided to teach myself to code and I was finally able to build this website.

I want to use this place to share not only my thoughts, my favorite books and travel photos, but also my learnings in web development and some code snippets I consider to be useful to others.

Welcome to my own little corner of the web!
