This is Kazuo Ishiguro's portrait of Stevens, the perfect butler, and of his fading, insular world in post-World War II England.

Favorite quotes from the book:

> “What is the point of worrying oneself too much about what one could or could not have done to control the course one's life took? Surely it is enough that the likes of you and I at least try to make our small contribution count for something true and worthy. And if some of us are prepared to sacrifice much in life in order to pursue such aspirations, surely that in itself, whatever the outcome, cause for pride and contentment.”

> “The evening's the best part of the day. You've done your day's work. Now you can put your feet up and enjoy it.”
