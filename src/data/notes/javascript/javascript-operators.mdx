Numeric data in JavaScript is represented by the `Number` data type.

## Add Two Numbers

In JavaScript, like in mathematics, the `+` symbol is used as an addition operator when in between two number.

Example:

```js
var randomNumber = 7 + 10; // 17
```

## Subtract One Number from Another

JavaScript uses the `-` symbol for subtraction, in order to subtract one number from another:

```js
var randomNumber = 10 - 5; // 5
```

## Multiply Two Numbers

JavaScript uses the `*` symbol for multiplication of two numbers:

```js
var randomNumber = 10 * 10; // 100
```

## Divide One Number by Another

JavaScript uses the `/` symbol in order to divide one number by another:

```js
var randomNumber = 100 / 10; // 10
```

## Increment a Number

In JavaScript, we can use the `++` operator to increment or add one to a variable:

```js
i++;
```

is the equivalent of

```js
i = i + 1;
```

## Decrement a Number

In JavaScript, we can use the `--` operator to decrement or decrease a variable value by one:

```js
i--;
```

is the equivalent of

```js
i = i - 1;
```

## Create Decimal Numbers

Variables can store also decimal number, which are referred to also as `floating point numbers` or simply `floats`.

```js
var myDecimal = 9.9;
```

## Multiply Two Decimals

Just like with whole numbers, in JavaScript, we can perform calculations also with decimal numbers:

```js
var product = 2.0 * 2.5; // 5
```

## Divide One Decimal by Another

Now let's divide one decimal by another:

```js
var quotient = 6.6 / 2.0; // 3.3
```

## Finding a Remainder

In programming, it's common to check if a number is `even` (divisible by 2) or `odd` (not divisible by 2).

The remainder operator `%` gives the remainder of the division of two numbers:

```js
17 % 2 = 1; // 17 ==> Odd
10 % 2 = 0; // 10 ==> Even
```

We can break this down by:

```js
Math.floor(17 / 2) = 8;
8 * 2 = 16;
17 - 16 = 1; // Remainder
```

## Compound Assignment With Augmented Addition

In programming, we use assignments to modify the content of a variable.
Moreover, other than assigning a new value, we saw also how to perform basic mathematical operation.

In JavaScript, we can combine a mathematical operator and the assignment operator and obtain a new operator used for augmented addition `+=`:

```js
var myFavoriteNumber = 1;
myFavoriteNumber += 16;
console.log(myFavoriteNumber); // 17
```

## Compound Assignment With Augmented Subtraction

Just like the `+=` operator we saw before, `-=` subtracts a number from a variable:

```js
var myFavoriteNumber = 4;
myFavoriteNumber -= 1;
console.log(myFavoriteNumber); // 3
```

## Compound Assignment With Augmented Multiplication

Using the `*=` operator, we can multiply a variable by a number:

```js
var myFavoriteNumber = 5;
myFavoriteNumber *= 6;
console.log(myFavoriteNumber); // 30
```

## Compound Assignment With Augmented Division

Using the `/=` operator, we can divide a variable by another number:

```js
var myFavoriteNumber = 10;
myFavoriteNumber /= 2;
console.log(myFavoriteNumber); // 5
```
