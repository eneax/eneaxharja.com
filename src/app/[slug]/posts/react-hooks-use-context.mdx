In React, you encapsulate UI and state inside of components and compose them together to create an application. Whenever you have state that multiple components depend on, you use callback functions to pass that state up to the nearest parent component and then pass it down via props.

This approach works well for small applications, but as your application grows, it becomes more difficult to manage state. You end up with a lot of props that are passed down through multiple layers of components.

To solve this problem, React comes with a built-in API called Context. It allows you to pass data through the component tree without having to pass props down manually at every level.

> Context is only a mechanism for transferring data, not a state manager.

It involves three steps:

1. Creating a Context by calling `React.createContext`:

```jsx
// File: LanguageContext.js

import * as React from "react";

const LanguageContext = React.createContext({
  language: "en",
  setLanguage: () => {},
});

export default LanguageContext;
```

2. Deciding what to transfer and to where

Now you need to decide what data to transfer and where to make it available in the application. When you created a Context in the previous step, you created an object with a `Provider` property. This property accepts a `value` prop that represents the data you want to transfer to any component, no matter how nested, that is a child of the `Provider` component.

```jsx
// File: LanguageProvider.js

import * as React from "react";
import LanguageContext from "./LanguageContext";

export default function LanguageProvider({ children }) {
  const [language, setLanguage] = React.useState("en");

  return (
    <LanguageContext.Provider value={{ language, setLanguage }}>
      {children}
    </LanguageContext.Provider>
  );
}
```

Once you have created a `Provider` component, you can use it to wrap any component that needs access to the transferred data.

```jsx
// File: main.js

import { createRoot } from "react-dom/client";

import LanguageProvider from "./LanguageProvider";
import App from "./App";

const rootElement = document.getElementById("root");
const root = createRoot(rootElement);

root.render(
  <LanguageProvider>
    <App />
  </LanguageProvider>
);
```

Let's use the `LanguageProvider` component to wrap the `App` component. This means that the `App` component and all of its children will have access to the data being transferred.

```jsx
// File: App.js

import LanguageSelector from "./LanguageSelector";

export default function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      <LanguageSelector />
    </div>
  );
}
```

3. Access the transfered data from inside a component

To get access to what was passed to the `value` prop of the `Provider`, you need to use React's `useContext` hook, passing it the `Context` as the first argument.

```jsx
// File: LanguageSelector.js

import * as React from "react";
import LanguageContext from "./LanguageContext";

export default function LanguageSelector() {
  const { language, setLanguage } = React.useContext(LanguageContext);

  return (
    <div>
      <p>{language}</p>
      <button onClick={() => setLanguage("en")}>English</button>
      <button onClick={() => setLanguage("it")}>Italian</button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

When you invoke `useContext` by passing it a `Context` object, it will return what was passed to the prop `value` of the nearest `Provider` component of the same `Context`.

However, if there is no parent `Provider` in the component tree where `useContext` is used, the `App` component will get its value from the first parameter passed to `createContext` when the `Context` object was created.

```jsx
import * as React from "react";

const ThemeContext = React.createContext("light"); // default value is "light"

function ChildComponent() {
  const theme = React.useContext(ThemeContext);

  return <div>{theme}</div>;
}

function ParentComponent() {
  return (
    <ThemeContext.Provider value="dark">
      <ChildComponent />
    </ThemeContext.Provider>
  );
}
```

Although the `ThemeContext` object was created with a default value of `light`, the `ChildComponent` will use the `dark` value, because it has a parent `ThemeContext.Provider` with a value of `dark`.

The examples above represent small demos of how to use React Context. To see the real power of Context, you need to use it in a real application.

Think of an application that uses internationalization and localization, where you need to pass locale data to any component in the component tree, no matter how deeply nested they are.
