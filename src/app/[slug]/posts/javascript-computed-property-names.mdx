Computed property names allow you to create object properties with dynamic keys in ES6. Instead of specifying a fixed key name, an expression can be used to compute the property name at runtime.

When creating an object, you can write the keys as strings:

```js
const character = {
  name: "Mario",
  occupation: "Plumber",
};
```

But what if we want to use a variable as the key name? This is where computed property names come in handy:

```js
const character = {
  name: "Mario",
  occupation: "Plumber",
};

function getCharacter(character) {
  return {
    [character.name]: character.occupation,
  };
}

const mario = getCharacter(character);
console.log(mario); // { Mario: 'Plumber' }
```

The expression inside `[]` is evaluated and its result is used as the property name. In the example above, we use the `name` property of the `character` object as the key name for the new object. This allows us to create dynamic object properties, based on the values of other properties.
