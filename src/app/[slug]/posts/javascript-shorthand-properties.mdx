Shorthand properties and methods are a feature introduced in ECMAScript 2015 (ES6) that provides a more concise syntax for defining object literals in JavaScript.

## Shorthand Properties

When the object key (property name) and the variable name are the same, you can omit the property name. Instead of `{ name: name }`, you can simply write `{ name }`.

```js
function createCharacter(name, occupation) {
  return {
    name: name,
    occupation: occupation,
    timestamp: Date.now(),
  };
}

// With shorthand properties syntax
function createCharacter(name, occupation) {
  return {
    name,
    occupation,
    timestamp: Date.now(),
  };
}
```

## Shorthand Methods

A function that is a property on an object is called a method. Methods defined in object literals are called shorthand methods.

Shorthand methods use the `this` keyword to refer to the parent object. When defining a method in an object literal, you can omit the `function` keyword altogether.

```js
const character = {
  name: "Mario",
  greet: function () {
    return `I am, ${this.name}!`;
  },
};

// With shorthand methods syntax
const character = {
  name: "Mario",
  greet() {
    return `I am, ${this.name}!`;
  },
};
```

Shorthand properties and methods are a great way to make code more readable and concise. They are widely used in modern JavaScript codebases.
