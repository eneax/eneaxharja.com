In JavaScript there are three ways to declare variables: `var`, `let` and `const`. To understand the differences between them, you need to know concepts such as variable declaration and initialization, scope and hoisting.

## TL;DR

`var`

- function scope
- `undefined` when accessing before declaration

`let`

- block scope
- `ReferenceError` when accessing before declaration

`const`

- block scope
- `ReferenceError` when accessing before declaration
- reassignment is not allowed

## Variable Declarations and Initialization

To understand the concept of variable declaration and initialization, let us first clarify the difference between a variable and a value.

The most fundamental concept in JavaScript is the value. The JavaScript universe contains several values, and when I write code, I refer to these values and interact with them.

A variable is not a value. A variable is like a wire that points to a particular value. We can change the value it points to by using the assignment operator `=`.

For example, when you write `var greeting = "hello"` you create a variable called `greeting` and make it point to the value `"hello"`.

There are two rules to follow when using the `=` assignment operator:

- the left side of the assignment must be a variable (or wire)
- the right side of the assignment must be an expression (or question you ask to JavaScript) that results in a value.

Variable declaration is the process of creating a variable. Variable initialization is the process of pointing a variable to a value for the first time.

```js
var greeting; // -> Declaration
console.log(greeting); // undefined
greeting = "hello"; // -> Initialization
console.log(greeting); // hello
```

In JavaScript, when you declare a variable, it is automatically initialized with the value `undefined`. The previous example can be rewritten as follows:

```js
var greeting = undefined; // -> Declaration and Initialization
console.log(greeting); // undefined
greeting = "hello"; // -> Reassignment
console.log(greeting); // hello
```

## Scope

Scope is the context in which variables and functions are accessible inside a program.

Variables declared with `var` inside a function are accessible only inside that function or any nested functions. This is known as function scope.

```js
function sayHello() {
  var greeting = "hello";
  return greeting;
}

sayHello(); // hello
console.log(greeting); // ReferenceError: greeting is not defined
```

In the above example, the variable `greeting` is declared inside the `sayHello` function and is not accessible outside it.

However, the variable `greeting` can be accessed inside the function and any nested functions.

```js
function sayHello() {
  var greeting = "hello";

  function formatGreeting() {
    return greeting.toUpperCase();
  }

  return formatGreeting();
}

sayHello(); // HELLO
console.log(greeting); // ReferenceError: greeting is not defined
```

## Hoisting

Hoisting refers to the process of initializing variables with the value `undefined` when they are created. This process occurs during the creation phase of the execution context.

Variables declared with `var` are hoisted to the top of their scope. This means that a variable can be accessed before it is declared.

Let's take the previous example and see how hoisting affects it.

```js
function sayHello() {
  console.log(greeting); // undefined
  var greeting = "hello";

  function formatGreeting() {
    return greeting.toUpperCase();
  }

  return formatGreeting();
}

sayHello(); // HELLO
```

In the above example, the variable `greeting` is accessed before it is declared. This is possible because of hoisting. During the creation phase of the execution context, the variable `greeting` is initialized with the value `undefined` and then assigned the value `"hello"`.

```js
function sayHello() {
  var greeting; // -> Hoisting (Declaration and Initialization with undefined)
  console.log(greeting); // undefined
  greeting = "hello"; // -> Assignment

  function formatGreeting() {
    return greeting.toUpperCase();
  }

  return formatGreeting();
}

sayHello(); // HELLO
```

## var and let in Comparison

The main difference between `var` and `let` is that the variables declared with `let` are block-scoped. This means that they are accessible only within the block in which they are declared. A block is anything wrapped in curly braces `{}`, such as a loop or conditional statement.

```js
if (true) {
  let greeting = "hello";
}

console.log(greeting); // ReferenceError: greeting is not defined
```

In the above example, the variable `greeting` is declared inside the block of the `if` statement and is not accessible outside it.

The other difference between `var` and `let` is that variables declared with `let` are not hoisted. This means that a variable cannot be accessed before it is declared.

If you try to do this, instead of getting `undefined`, you will get a `ReferenceError`.

```js
function sayHello() {
  console.log(greeting); // ReferenceError: Cannot access 'greeting' before initialization
  let greeting = "hello";

  function formatGreeting() {
    return greeting.toUpperCase();
  }

  return formatGreeting();
}
```

## let and const in Comparison

The main difference between `let` and `const` is that variables declared with `const` cannot be reassigned. This means that once a variable is initialized with a value, it cannot be reassigned to a different value.

```js
const greeting = "hello";
greeting = "hi"; // SyntaxError: Identifier 'greeting' has already been declared
```

In the previous example, the variable `greeting` is initialized with the value `"hello"`. When you try to reassign it to the value `"hi"`, you get a `SyntaxError`.

However, it is important to note that the value of a variable declared using `const` can still be mutated (changed).

```js
const person = {
  name: "Mario",
};

person.name = "Luigi";
console.log(person); // { name: "Luigi" }
```

In the previous example, the variable `person` points to an object value. Although we cannot point `person` to a different value (no reassignment), we can still mutate the `name` property of the object.

One last thing to note about `const` is that it must be initialized when it is declared. If you try to declare a `const` variable without initializing it, you will get a `SyntaxError`.

```js
const greeting = "hello"; // OK
const greeting; // SyntaxError: Missing initializer in const declaration
```

## Conclusion

In JavaScript there are three ways to declare variables: `var`, `let`, and `const`. The main differences between them are:

- `var` is function-scoped and hoisted (`undefined` when accessed before declaration)
- `let` is block-scoped and not hoisted (`ReferenceError` when accessed before declaration)
- `const` is block-scoped, not hoisted, and cannot be reassigned

ECMAScript 2015 introduced `let` and `const` to address the issues with `var`, while newer versions of ECMAScript have continued to improve the language by introducing new features and syntax.

Personally, I prefer to avoid using `var` altogether because of its hoisting behavior. I choose to use `const` by default and `let` only when I need to reassign a variable.
