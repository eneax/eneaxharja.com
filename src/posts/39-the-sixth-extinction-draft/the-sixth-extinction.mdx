The Sixth Extinction

Quotes:

> those of us alive today not only are witnessing one of the rarest events in life’s history, we are also causing it.

> “All these facts, consistent among themselves, and not opposed by any report, seem to me to prove the existence of a world previous to ours,” Cuvier said. “But what was this primitive earth? And what revolution was able to wipe it out?”

> “The present is the key to the past.”

> In one of the most often-quoted passages of On the Origin of Species, Darwin wrote: It may be said that natural selection is daily and hourly scrutinising, throughout the world, every variation, even the slightest; rejecting that which is bad, preserving and adding up all that is good; silently and insensibly working, whenever and wherever opportunity offers.

> In times of extreme stress, the whole concept of fitness, at least in a Darwinian sense, loses its meaning: how could a creature be adapted, either well or ill, for conditions it has never before encountered in its entire evolutionary history?

> a pattern emerged: mass extinctions seemed to take place at regular intervals of roughly twenty-six million years.

> “If you ask me what’s going to happen in the future, I think the strongest evidence we have is there is going to be a reduction in biodiversity,”

> “Some highly tolerant organisms will become more abundant, but overall diversity will be lost. This is what has happened in all these times of major mass extinction.”

> “Time is the essential ingredient, but in the modern world there is no time.”

> Reefs are organic paradoxes—obdurate, ship-destroying ramparts constructed by tiny gelatinous creatures. They are part animal, part vegetable, and part mineral, at once teeming with life and, at the same time, mostly dead.

> The way corals change the world—with huge construction projects spanning multiple generations—might be likened to the way that humans do, with this crucial difference. Instead of displacing other creatures, corals support them.

> Reefs are thus not just underwater rainforests; they are rainforests in a marine Sahara.

> As a general rule, the variety of life is most impoverished at the poles and richest at low latitudes.

> Warming today is taking place at least ten times faster than it did at the end of the last glaciation, and at the end of all those glaciations that preceded it.

> To keep up, organisms will have to migrate, or otherwise adapt, at least ten times more quickly.

> “In other kinds of human disturbances there were always spatial refuges. Climate affects everything.”

> “there wasn’t just suddenly this new equilibrium with fewer species. There was this steady degradation in the diversity over time.”

> “When you find one thing that depends on something else that, in turn, depends on something else, the whole series of interactions depends on constancy,”

> By transporting Asian species to North America, and North American species to Australia, and Australian species to Africa, and European species to Antarctica, we are, in effect, reassembling the world into one enormous supercontinent—what biologists sometimes refer to as the New Pangaea.

> “If we look far enough ahead, the eventual state of the biological world will become not more complex, but simpler—and poorer,”

> “We live in a zoologically impoverished world, from which all the hugest, and fiercest, and strangest forms have recently disappeared,” Alfred Russel Wallace observed.

> “And it is, no doubt, a much better world for us now they have gone. Yet it is surely a marvellous fact, and one that has hardly been sufficiently dwelt upon, this sudden dying out of so many large mammalia, not in one place only but over half the land surface of the globe.”

> “The gestation period of an elephant, for example, is twenty-two months. Elephants don’t have twins, and they don’t start to reproduce until they’re in their teens.

> the megafauna weren’t doing anything wrong; it’s just that when humans appeared, “the rules of the survival game” changed.

> Alroy has described the megafauna extinction as a “geologically instantaneous ecological catastrophe too gradual to be perceived by the people who unleashed it.”

> It demonstrates, he has written, that humans “are capable of driving virtually any large mammal species extinct, even though they are also capable of going to great lengths to guarantee that they do not.”

> Before humans emerged on the scene, being large and slow to reproduce was a highly successful strategy, and outsized creatures dominated the planet. Then, in what amounts to a geologic instant, this strategy became a loser’s game.

> Though it might be nice to imagine there once was a time when man lived in harmony with nature, it’s not clear that he ever really did.

> The Neanderthals lived in Europe for more than a hundred thousand years and during that period they had no more impact on their surroundings than any other large vertebrate. There is every reason to believe that if humans had not arrived on the scene, the Neanderthals would be there still,

> With the capacity to represent the world in signs and symbols comes the capacity to change it, which, as it happens, is also the capacity to destroy it. A tiny set of genetic variations divides us from the Neanderthals, but that has made all the difference.

> What this history reveals, in its ups and its downs, is that life is extremely resilient but not infinitely so. There have been very long uneventful stretches and very, very occasionally “revolutions on the surface of the earth.”

> “We’re seeing right now that a mass extinction can be caused by human beings.”

> The one feature these disparate events have in common is change and, to be more specific, rate of change. When the world changes faster than species can adapt, many fall out.

> As soon as humans started using signs and symbols to represent the natural world, they pushed beyond the limits of that world.

> “Right now we are in the midst of the Sixth Extinction, this time caused solely by humanity’s transformation of the ecological landscape.”

> In an extinction event of our own making, what happens to us?

> Among the many lessons that emerge from the geologic record, perhaps the most sobering is that in life, as in mutual funds, past performance is no guarantee of future results.

> “Homo sapiens might not only be the agent of the sixth extinction, but also risks being one of its victims.”

> Right now, in the amazing moment that to us counts as the present, we are deciding, without quite meaning to, which evolutionary pathways will remain open and which will forever be closed. No other creature has ever managed this, and it will, unfortunately, be our most enduring legacy.
