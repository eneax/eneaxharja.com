Cal Newport shows how to use technology in order to support your goals and values, rather than letting it use you.

Favorite quotes from the book:

> “The tycoons of social media have to stop pretending that they're friendly nerd gods building a better world and admit they're just tobacco farmers in T-shirts selling an addictive product to children. Because, let's face it, checking your “likes” is the new smoking.”

> “Digital Minimalism A philosophy of technology use in which you focus your online time on a small number of carefully selected and optimized activities that strongly support things you value, and then happily miss out on everything else.”
