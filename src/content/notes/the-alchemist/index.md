Paulo Coelho's masterpiece tells the story of Santiago, an Andalusian shepherd boy who travels in search of a world treasure. His search will lead him to riches very different from those he had imagined.

Favorite quotes from the book:

> “And, when you want something, all the universe conspires in helping you to achieve it.”

> “It's the possibility of having a dream come true that makes life interesting.”

> “When we love, we always strive to become better than we are. When we strive to become better than we are, everything around us becomes better too.”
