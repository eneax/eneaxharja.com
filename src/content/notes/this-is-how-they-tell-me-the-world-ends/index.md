Filled with spies, hackers and arms dealers, this book is a surprising and compelling journalistic achievement by Nicole Perlroth.

Favorite quotes from the book:

> "At their core, hackers are just natural tinkerers. They can't see a system and not want to break it down to its very last bit, see where it takes them, and then build it back up for some alternate use."

> "People were the primary access points, given that somebody held the data room combination, the encryption codes, the passwords, and the firewall manuals," Gosler told his CIA trainees. "People had written the software. People managed the data systems. Ops officers should recruit computer hackers, systems administrators, fiber-optic techs, and even the janitor if he could get you into the right data-storage area or fiber-optic cable."

> "There are only two types of companies â€” those that know they've been compromised, and those that don't know."

> "In any market there is a fool."

> "She told me the only way to get a hacker to stop hacking was to marry him off. If only it were that simple."

> "The barrier between the physical and digital worlds is wearing thin."
