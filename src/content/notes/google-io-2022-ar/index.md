Google held its annual I/O event, with many announcements bringing together the best of Google's technologies and products to showcase the latest in augmented reality.

My favorite moment of the Google I/O 2022 event was the concept of AR glasses that show real-time translation of what people are saying to you in languages you don't understand. Sort of like subtitles for the real world.

From Sundar Pichai's official [keynote address](https://blog.google/technology/developers/io-2022-keynote):

> Looking ahead, there's a new frontier of computing, which has the potential to extend all of this even further, and that is augmented reality.

> It's important we design in a way that is built for the real world â€” and doesn't take you away from it. And AR gives us new ways to accomplish this.
