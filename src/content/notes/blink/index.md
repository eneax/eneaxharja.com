Malcolm Gladwell writes about how we think without thinking, about choices that we seem to make in an instant, but actually aren't as simple as they seem.

Favorite quotes from the book:

> “The key to good decision making is not knowledge. It is understanding. We are swimming in the former. We are desperately lacking in the latter.”

> “We have, as human beings, a storytelling problem. We're a bit too quick to come up with explanations for things we don't really have an explanation for.”
