Favorite quotes from the book:

> "Character is built not in good times, but in bad times."

> "Think of your life as a rainbow arcing across the horizon of this world. You appear, have a chance to blaze in the sky, then you disappear."

> "Because the people who are crazy enough to think they can change the world are the ones who do."

> "We are what we repeatedly do. Excellence, then, is not an act, but a habit. - Aristotle"

> "Again, you can't connect the dots looking forward; you can only connect them looking backwards. So you have to trust that the dots will somehow connect in your future."

> "Your work is going to fill a large part of your life, and the only way to be truly satisfied is to do what you believe is great work. And the only way to do great work is to love what you do. If you haven't found it yet, keep looking. Don't settle. As with all matters of the heart, you'll know when you find it. And, like any great relationship, it just gets better and better as the years roll on. So keep looking. Don't settle."

> "If today were the last day of my life, would I want to do what I am about to do today?"

> "Because almost everything — all external expectations, all pride, all fear of embarrassment or failure — these things just fall away in the face of death, leaving only what is truly important."

> "Remembering that you are going to die is the best way I know to avoid the trap of thinking you have something to lose. You are already naked. There is no reason not to follow your heart."

> "...because death is very likely the single best invention of life. It is life's change agent. It clears out the old to make way for the new."

> "Don't be trapped by dogma — which is living with the results of other people's thinking. Don't let the noise of others' opinions drown out your own inner voice."

> "Life can be much broader once you discover one simple fact — and that is: everything around you that you call life was made up by people that were no smarter than you."
