The book is both a warning and a call to action, in which the author, Kim Stanley Robinson, tells the story of how climate change will affect us all.

Favorite quotes from the book:

> "No one is safe until all are secure"

> "Do you really think we can get significant legal standing for people who don’t exist yet?"

> "To be clear, concluding in brief: there is enough for all. So there should be no more people living in poverty. And there should be no more billionaires. Enough should be a human right, a floor below which no one can fall; also a ceiling above which no one can rise. Enough is a good as a feast—or better."

> "It's the structure of feeling in our time; we can’t think in anything but economic terms, our ethics must be quantified and rated for the effects that our actions have on GDP"

> "A new life in a new city. After such giant changes, would I still be me? Of course I recalled the poem about how you can never escape yourself, every place is the same because you are the one moving to that place."

> "It was so hard to imagine that a mind could be gone. All those thoughts that you never tell anyone, all those dreams, all that entire pocket universe: gone. A character unlike any other character, a consciousness. It didn’t seem possible"

> "Who can tell the riddle of their own true self?"
