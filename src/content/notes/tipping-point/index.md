Malcolm Gladwell analyzes fashion trends, smoking, children's television, direct mail, and the early days of the American Revolution for clues on how to make ideas infectious.

Favorite quotes from the book:

> “The tipping point is that magic moment when an idea, trend, or social behavior crosses a threshold, tips, and spreads like wildfire.”

> “That is the paradox of the epidemic: that in order to create one contagious movement, you often have to create many small movements first.”
