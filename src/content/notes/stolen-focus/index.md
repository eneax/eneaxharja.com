> "It's when you set aside your distractions, he said, that you begin to see what you were distracting yourself from."

> "I came to this realisation that my job in a way is to think something that is different from everyone else – but I was in an environment where I was just getting all the same information as everyone else, and I was just thinking the same things as everyone else."

> "The more information you pump in, the less time people can focus on any individual piece of it."
