Christiana Figueres and Tom Rivett-Carnac's book is a compelling and urgent call to action on climate change, highlighting the existential threat it poses. They present two possible futures: one with dire consequences due to inaction and another in which collective action can lead to a sustainable future.

Favorite quotes from the book:

> Denying climate change is tantamount to saying you don't believe in gravity. The science of climate change is not a belief, a religion, or a political ideology. It presents facts that are measurable and verifiable.

> Failure to make hard choices now will rob our children and grandchildren of their rightful future.

> Focus on where you're going, not on where you've been. Cultivate your constructive vision for the future and hold on to it, come what may. When you can see where you're going, you won't be so afraid of losing your grip on the past.

> A compelling vision is like a hook in the future. It connects you to the pockets of possibility that are emerging and helps you pull them into the present. Hold on to that.
