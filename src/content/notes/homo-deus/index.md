Yuval Noah Harari turns his focus toward humanity's future, and our quest to upgrade humans into gods.

Favorite quotes from the book:

> “This is the best reason to learn history: not in order to predict the future, but to free yourself of the past and imagine alternative destinies. Of course this is not total freedom - we cannot avoid being shaped by the past. But some freedom is better than none.”

> “We do not become satisfied by leading a peaceful and prosperous existence. Rather, we become satisfied when reality matches our expectations. The bad news is that as conditions improve, expectations balloon.”

> “The most common reaction of the human mind to achievement is not satisfaction, but craving for more.”

> “People are usually afraid of change because they fear the unknown. But the single greatest constant of history is that everything changes.”
