Rolf Dobelli argues why news is irrelevant and suggests ways to avoid it in order to lead a more fulfilling life.

Favorite quotes from the book:

> "News is to the mind what sugar is to the body: appetising, easily digestible and extremely damaging. The media is feeding us titbits that taste palatable but do nothing to satisfy our hunger for knowledge."

> "Ideally you want to be working, reading a book or calmly watching the world go by as you let your mind wander."

> "As soon as a piece of news is in the world, it becomes public knowledge and you will not enjoy an advantage in knowing about it. You will, however, gain a huge advantage over your peers and competitors if firstly you have a deeper awareness of the background context and secondly, if that context is not widely disseminated. And you will only reach this awareness through intensive reading and thought."

> "Know your circle of competence and stick within it. The size of that circle is not very important; knowing its boundaries, however, is vital."

> "The world can stay irrational longer than you can stay insane."

> "What constitutes a good life? To put it another way: how should you live your life so that you can one day look back on it as 'successful' and 'good'? Until you can answer this fundamental question, your life will be a non-stop crisis-coping machine. Without a clear philosophy here, you risk life passing you by."

> "You become what you give your attention to ... If you yourself don't choose what thoughts and images you expose yourself to, someone else will."
