Three deep thinkers-Henry Kissinger, Eric Schmidt and Daniel Huttenlocher-present a brilliant analysis of the scope of AI and its profound implications for our present and future.

Favorite quotes from the book:

> "AI accesses reality differently from the way humans access it. And if the feats it is performing are any guide, it may access different aspects of reality from the ones humans access. Its functioning portends progress toward the essence of things — progress that philosophers, theologians, and scientists have sought, with partial success, for millennia."

> "The advent of AI obliges us to confront whether there is a form of logic that humans have not achieved or cannot achieve, exploring aspects of reality we have never known and may never directly know."

> "What is reality? What are people seeking to know and experience, and how will they know when they encounter it? Can humans perceive reality itself as opposed to its reflections? If so, how? What does it mean to be and to know?"

> "Throughout history, a nation's political influence has tended to be roughly correlative to its military power and strategic capabilities — its ability, even if exerted primarily through implicit threats, to inflict damage on other societies."

> "A central paradox of our digital age is that the greater a society's digital capacity, the more vulnerable it becomes."

> "In an age in which machines increasingly perform tasks only humans used to be capable of, what, then, will constitute our identity as human beings?"

> "The irony is that even as digitization is making an increasing amount of information available, it is diminishing the space required for deep, concentrated thought."
