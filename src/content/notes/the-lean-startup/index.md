Eric Ries provides a scientific approach to continually testing ideas and adapting and adjusting before it's too late.

Favorite quotes from the book:

> “The only way to win is to learn faster than anyone else.”

> “As you consider building your own minimum viable product, let this simple rule suffice: remove any feature, process, or effort that does not contribute directly to the learning you seek.”

> “if you cannot fail, you cannot learn.”
