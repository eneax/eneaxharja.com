Peter Thiel describes how progress comes from learning to think for yourself (the most important skill that every leader must master) and it can be achieved in any industry or area of business.

Favorite quotes from the book:

> “What important truth do very few people agree with you on?”

> “Tolstoy opens Anna Karenina by observing: “All happy families are alike; each unhappy family is unhappy in its own way.” Business is the opposite. All happy companies are different: each one earns a monopoly by solving a unique problem. All failed companies are the same: they failed to escape competition.”
