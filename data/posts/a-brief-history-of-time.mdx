Stephen Hawking tells, in language we all can understand, the exotic realms of black holes and quarks, of antimatter, "arrows of time", and of the big bang.

Favorite quotes from the book:

> "Even if there is only one possible unified theory, it is just a set of rules and equations. What is it that breathes fire into the equations and makes a universe for them to describe? The usual approach of science of constructing a mathematical model cannot answer the questions of why there should be a universe for the model to describe. Why does the universe go to all the bother of existing?"

> "The universe doesn't allow perfection."

> "If time travel is possible, where are the tourists from the future?"
