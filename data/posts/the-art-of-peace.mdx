Morihei Ueshiba (1883-1969), founder of the Japanese martial art of Aikido, taught that the real way of the warrior is based on compassion, wisdom, fearlessness, and love of nature.

Favorite quote from the book:

> “As soon as you concern yourself with the "good" and "bad" of your fellows, you create an opening in your heart for maliciousness to enter. Testing, competing with, and criticizing others weakens and defeats you.”
