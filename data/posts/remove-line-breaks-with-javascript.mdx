This hot tip is all about using plain JavaScript code to remove line breaks from a string.

In order to remove line breaks, we have to take into consideration three different types of line breaks, depending on the three operating system: `(\r\n){:js}` for Windows, `(\n){:js}` for Linux and `(\r){:js}` for macOS.

Let's first define the string variable with some [Hipster Ipsum](https://hipsum.co) text that we need to format:

```js title="Console"
const randomString =
  "Kinfolk tumeric hell of meggings.\n Man braid leggings thundercats, glossier palo santo farm-to-table letterpress kale chips gastropub chartreuse selfies stumptown 8-bit small batch.\r Paleo letterpress la croix DIY poke. Echo park next level hoodie hella. Semiotics taxidermy hexagon banjo chillwave subway tile portland crucifix kogi squid pabst mixtape single-origin coffee.\r\n Cliche kinfolk air plant, echo park mixtape franzen 8-bit affogato messenger bag vape jean shorts yuccie beard. Food truck copper mug coloring book portland aesthetic.";
```

Now, using `.replace(){:js}` method with a regular expression we can remove all the above types of line breaks:

```js title="Console"
randomString = randomString.replace(/(\r\n|\n|\r)/gm, "");
```

If we want to replace all 3 types of line breaks with a space:

```js title="Console"
randomString = randomString.replace(/(\r\n|\n|\r)/gm, " ");
```

Finally, in case you want to replace line breaks with a non breaking space:

```js title="Console"
randomString = randomString.replace(/(\r\n|\n|\r)/gm, "\u00A0");
```
