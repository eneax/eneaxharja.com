Yuval Noah Harari addresses the challenge of navigating life in the face of constant and disorienting change and raises the important questions we need to ask ourselves in order to survive.

Favorite quotes from the book:

> "In a world deluged by irrelevant information, clarity is power."

> "Questions you cannot answer are usually far better for you than answers you cannot question."

> "Morality doesn't mean 'following divine commands'. It means 'reducing suffering'. Hence in order to act morally, you donâ€™t need to believe in any myth or story. You just need to develop a deep appreciation of suffering."
