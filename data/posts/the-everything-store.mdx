Brad Stone tells the story of Amazon.com, one of the most successful companies in the world, and of its brilliant founder, Jeff Bezos.

Favorite quotes from the book:

> “When you are eighty years old, and in a quiet moment of reflection narrating for only yourself the most personal version of your life story, the telling that will be most compact and meaningful will be the series of choices you have made. In the end, we are our choices. —Jeff Bezos, commencement speech at Princeton University, May 30, 2010”

> “It’s easier to invent the future than to predict it.”
