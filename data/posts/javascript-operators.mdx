Numeric data in JavaScript is represented by the `Number{:js}` data type.

## Add Two Numbers

In JavaScript, like in mathematics, the `+{:js}` symbol is used as an addition operator when in between two number.

Example:

```js title="Console"
var randomNumber = 7 + 10; // 17
```

## Subtract One Number from Another

JavaScript uses the `-{:js}` symbol for subtraction, in order to subtract one number from another:

```js title="Console"
var randomNumber = 10 - 5; // 5
```

## Multiply Two Numbers

JavaScript uses the `*{:js}` symbol for multiplication of two numbers:

```js title="Console"
var randomNumber = 10 * 10; // 100
```

## Divide One Number by Another

JavaScript uses the `/{:js}` symbol in order to divide one number by another:

```js title="Console"
var randomNumber = 100 / 10; // 10
```

## Increment a Number

In JavaScript, we can use the `++{:js}` operator to increment or add one to a variable:

```js title="Console"
i++;
```

is the equivalent of

```js title="Console"
i = i + 1;
```

## Decrement a Number

In JavaScript, we can use the `--{:js}` operator to decrement or decrease a variable value by one:

```js title="Console"
i--;
```

is the equivalent of

```js title="Console"
i = i - 1;
```

## Create Decimal Numbers

Variables can store also decimal number, which are referred to also as `floating point numbers{:js}` or simply `floats{:js}`.

```js title="Console"
var myDecimal = 9.9;
```

## Multiply Two Decimals

Just like with whole numbers, in JavaScript, we can perform calculations also with decimal numbers:

```js title="Console"
var product = 2.0 * 2.5; // 5
```

## Divide One Decimal by Another

Now let's divide one decimal by another:

```js title="Console"
var quotient = 6.6 / 2.0; // 3.3
```

## Finding a Remainder

In programming, it's common to check if a number is `even{:js}` (divisible by 2) or `odd{:js}` (not divisible by 2).

The remainder operator `%{:js}` gives the remainder of the division of two numbers:

```js title="Console"
17 % 2 = 1; // 17 ==> Odd
10 % 2 = 0; // 10 ==> Even
```

We can break this down by:

```js title="Console"
Math.floor(17 / 2) = 8;
8 * 2 = 16;
17 - 16 = 1; // Remainder
```

## Compound Assignment With Augmented Addition

In programming, we use assignments to modify the content of a variable.
Moreover, other than assigning a new value, we saw also how to perform basic mathematical operation.

In JavaScript, we can combine a mathematical operator and the assignment operator and obtain a new operator used for augmented addition `+={:js}`:

```js title="Console"
var myFavoriteNumber = 1;
myFavoriteNumber += 16;
console.log(myFavoriteNumber); // 17
```

## Compound Assignment With Augmented Subtraction

Just like the `+={:js}` operator we saw before, `-={:js}` subtracts a number from a variable:

```js title="Console"
var myFavoriteNumber = 4;
myFavoriteNumber -= 1;
console.log(myFavoriteNumber); // 3
```

## Compound Assignment With Augmented Multiplication

Using the `*={:js}` operator, we can multiply a variable by a number:

```js title="Console"
var myFavoriteNumber = 5;
myFavoriteNumber *= 6;
console.log(myFavoriteNumber); // 30
```

## Compound Assignment With Augmented Division

Using the `/={:js}` operator, we can divide a variable by another number:

```js title="Console"
var myFavoriteNumber = 10;
myFavoriteNumber /= 2;
console.log(myFavoriteNumber); // 5
```
