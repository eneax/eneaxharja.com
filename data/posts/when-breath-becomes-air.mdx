Favorite quotes from the book:

> You can't ever reach perfection, but you can believe in an asymptote toward which you are ceaselessly striving.

> Human knowledge is never contained in one person. It grows from the relationships we create between each other and the world, and still it is never complete.

> There is a moment, a cusp, when the sum of gathered experience is worn down by the details of living. We are never so wise as when we live in this moment.

> That message is simple: When you come to one of the many moments in life when you must give an account of yourself, provide a ledger of what you have been, and done, and meant to the world, do not, I pray, discount that you filled a dying man's days with a sated joy, a joy unknown to me in all my prior years, a joy that does not hunger for more and more, but rests, satisfied. In this time, right now, that is an enormous thing.
