Favorite quotes from the book:

> There are really four dimensions, three which we call the three planes of Space, and a fourth, Time.

> There is no difference between Time and any of the three dimensions of Space except that our consciousness moves along it.

> You know how on a flat surface, which has only two dimensions, we can represent a figure of a three-dimensional solid, and similarly they think that by models of three dimensions they could represent one of four â€” if they could master the perspective of the thing.

> We are always getting away from the present moment. Our mental existences, which are immaterial and have no dimensions, are passing along the Time-Dimension with a uniform velocity from the cradle to the grave.

> But you are wrong to say that we cannot move about in Time. For instance, if I am recalling an incident very vividly I go back to the instant of its occurrence: I become absent-minded, as you say. I jump back for a moment.
