Adam Alter writes about how our environment unconsciously shapes the judgments and decisions we make every day.

Favorite quotes from the book:

> “Each of us is an ongoing product of the world within us, the world between us, and the world around us—and their hidden capacity to shape our every thought, feeling, and behavior.”

> “Both physical and social pain seem less painful when we’re cushioned by symbolic reminders of money, even when the money isn’t real or doesn’t belong to us.”
