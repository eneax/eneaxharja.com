Machiavelli's thoughts on the qualities a ruler should possess.

Favorite quotes from the book:

> “Everyone sees what you appear to be, few experience what you really are.”

> “If an injury has to be done to a man it should be so severe that his vengeance need not be feared.”

> “The lion cannot protect himself from traps, and the fox cannot defend himself from wolves. One must therefore be a fox to recognize traps, and a lion to frighten wolves.”

> “Never attempt to win by force what can be won by deception.”
