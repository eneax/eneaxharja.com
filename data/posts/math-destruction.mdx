The mathematician and data scientist Cathy O'Neil reveals how the mathematical models being used today are unregulated and uncontestable, even when they're wrong.

Favorite quote from the book:

> “Big Data processes codify the past. They do not invent the future. Doing that requires moral imagination, and that’s something only humans can provide. We have to explicitly embed better values into our algorithms, creating Big Data models that follow our ethical lead. Sometimes that will mean putting fairness ahead of profit.”
