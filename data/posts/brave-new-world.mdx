In this dystopian novel, Aldous Huxley writes about a futuristic World State, inhabited by genetically modified citizens and an intelligence-based social hierarchy, which is challenged by only a single individual.

Favorite quotes from the book:

> “Actual happiness always looks pretty squalid in comparison with the overcompensations for misery. And, of course, stability isn't nearly so spectacular as instability. And being contented has none of the glamour of a good fight against misfortune, none of the picturesqueness of a struggle with temptation, or a fatal overthrow by passion or doubt. Happiness is never grand.”
