Psychiatrist Viktor Frankl's memoir is a description of life in Nazi death camps and its lessons for spiritual survival. The author argues that we cannot avoid suffering but we can choose how to cope with it, find meaning in it, and move forward with our lives with a renewed purpose.

Favorite quotes from the book:

> “When we are no longer able to change a situation, we are challenged to change ourselves.”

> “Everything can be taken from a man but one thing: the last of the human freedoms—to choose one's attitude in any given set of circumstances, to choose one's own way.”

> “Those who have a 'why' to live, can bear with almost any 'how'.”
