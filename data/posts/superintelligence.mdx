Nick Bostrom lays the foundation for understanding the future of humanity and intelligent life and reflects on what will happen when machines surpass humans in general intelligence.

Favorite quote from the book:

> “Far from being the smartest possible biological species, we are probably better thought of as the stupidest possible biological species capable of starting a technological civilization - a niche we filled because we got there first, not because we are in any sense optimally adapted to it.”
