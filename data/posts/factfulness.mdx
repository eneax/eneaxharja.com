Hans Rosling proofs with facts how the world, for all its imperfections, is in a much better state than we might think.

Favorite quotes from the book:

> “There's no room for facts when our minds are occupied by fear.”

> “human beings have a strong dramatic instinct toward binary thinking, a basic urge to divide things into two distinct groups, with nothing but an empty gap in between. We love to dichotomize. Good versus bad. Heroes versus villains. My country versus the rest. Dividing the world into two distinct sides is simple and intuitive, and also dramatic because it implies conflict, and we do it without thinking, all the time.”
