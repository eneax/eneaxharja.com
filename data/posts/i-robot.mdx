Isaac Asimov takes readers on an adventure into the not-so-distant future where man and machine struggle to redefine life, love, and consciousness.

Favorite quotes from the book:

> There was a time when humanity faced the universe alone and without a friend. Now he has creatures to help him; stronger creatures than himself, more faithful, more useful, and absolutely devoted to him. Mankind is no longer alone.

> One, a robot may not injure a human being, or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm.”

> “Two,” continued Powell, “a robot must obey the orders given it by human beings except where such orders would conflict with the First Law.”

> “And three, a robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the First or Second Laws.”

> People say "It's as plain as the nose on your face." But how much of the nose on your face can you see, unless someone holds a mirror up to you?
