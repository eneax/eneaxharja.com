Steve Krug's guide to help designers and developers understand the principles of intuitive navigation and information design.

Favorite quotes from the book:

> “If there's one thing you learn by working on a lot of different Web sites, it's that almost any design idea--no matter how appallingly bad--can be made usable in the right circumstances, with enough effort.”

> “It doesn't matter how many times I have to click, as long as each click is a mindless, unambiguous choice.”
