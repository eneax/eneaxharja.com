William Golding's Lord of the Flies is perhaps our most memorable novel about “the end of innocence, the darkness of man’s heart”.

Favorite quotes from the book:

> “Maybe there is a beast… maybe it's only us.”

> “The thing is - fear can't hurt you any more than a dream.”

> “I think women are foolish to pretend they are equal to men, they are far superior and always have been.”
