First, make sure to change the name of the branch on GitHub:

```bash title="Go to your GitHub repository"
https://github.com/:username/:repo-name/branches
```

Then, change the name of the branch locally:

```bash title="Terminal"
git branch -m master main
git fetch origin
git branch -u origin/main main
git remote set-head origin -a
```
