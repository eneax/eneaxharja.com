George Orwell's allegorical novel describes a scathing satire of an oppressed society's blind march toward totalitarianism.

Favorite quotes from the book:

> “All animals are equal, but some animals are more equal than others.”

> “Man is the only creature that consumes without producing. He does not give milk, he does not lay eggs, he is too weak to pull the plough, he cannot run fast enough to catch rabbits. Yet he is lord of all the animals. He sets them to work, he gives back to them the bare minimum that will prevent them from starving, and the rest he keeps for himself.”
