Malala Yousafzai refused to be silenced and fought for her right to an education, while the Taliban were taking control of the Swat Valley in Pakistan.

Favorite quotes from the book:

> “We realize the importance of our voices only when we are silenced.”

> “Education is education. We should learn everything and then choose which path to follow." Education is neither Eastern nor Western, it is human.”
