By default, the `gatsby-plugin-mdx{:js}` plugin supports frontmatter, so you can define values like `slug{:js}`, `date{:js}` and `title{:js}` at the beginning of your MDX document:

```mdx title="best-post-ever.mdx"
---
slug: "/best-post-ever"
date: "3000-01-01"
title: "Best Post Ever"

faq:
  - id: "1"
    question: "Question One"
    answer: "Answer One"

  - id: "2"
    question: "Question Two"
    answer: "Answer Two"

  - id: "3"
    question: "Question Three"
    answer: "Answer Three"
---
```

The frontmatter is also available in `props.pageContext.frontmatter{:js}` and can be accessed in blocks of JSX in your MDX document. This functionality can be very useful if you have repetitive content and want to loop over it.

In the example above, we have a list of faq questions. If you want to render all the faq on your page, you can either run a GraphQL query on your template file or simply import a React component into the MDX file:

```mdx title="best-post-ever.mdx"
---
slug: "/best-post-ever"
date: "3000-01-01"
title: "Best Post Ever"

faq:
  - id: "1"
    question: "Question One"
    answer: "Answer One"

  - id: "2"
    question: "Question Two"
    answer: "Answer Two"

  - id: "3"
    question: "Question Three"
    answer: "Answer Three"

import { Faq } from "../components/faq";

<h1>{props.pageContext.frontmatter.title}</h1>

<Faq faqItems={props.pageContext.frontmatter.faq} />
```
