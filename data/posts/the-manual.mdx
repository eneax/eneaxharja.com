Epictetus (c. 50-135 CE) was brought as a slave to Rome, where he became a great teacher, deeply influencing the future emperor Marcus Aurelius. The Manual is a collection of his essential teachings compiled by his closest student.

Favorite quotes from the book:

> “If someone tried to take control of your body and make you a slave, you would fight for freedom. Yet how easily you hand over your mind to anyone who insults you. When you dwell on their words and let them dominate your thoughts, you make them your master.”

> “Do not wish that all things will go well with you, but that you will go well with all things.”
