Written by the Roman emperor Marcus Aurelius, the Meditations offer a remarkable series of challenging spiritual reflections and exercises developed as the emperor struggled to understand himself and make sense of the universe.

Favorite quotes from the book:

> “You have power over your mind - not outside events. Realize this, and you will find strength.”

> “The happiness of your life depends upon the quality of your thoughts.”

> “Everything we hear is an opinion, not a fact. Everything we see is a perspective, not the truth.”

> “Waste no more time arguing about what a good man should be. Be one.”

> “If you are distressed by anything external, the pain is not due to the thing itself, but to your estimate of it; and this you have the power to revoke at any moment.”
