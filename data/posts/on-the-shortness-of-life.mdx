The Stoic writings of the philosopher Seneca offer powerful insights into the art of living.

Favorite quotes from the book:

> “You act like mortals in all that you fear, and like immortals in all that you desire”

> “It is not that we have so little time but that we lose so much. ... The life we receive is not short but we make it so; we are not ill provided but use what we have wastefully.”

> “They lose the day in expectation of the night, and the night in fear of the dawn.”

> “People are frugal in guarding their personal property; but as soon as it comes to squandering time they are most wasteful of the one thing in which it is right to be stingy.”
