A list of useful Git commands for everyday use.

### Stash

Stash is a way to save your work without committing it. It is useful when you want to change branches or pull the latest changes from a remote repository.

```bash title="Save a specific file"
git stash push <file>
```

```bash title="Save all changes"
git stash
```

```bash title="List all stashes"
git stash list
```

```bash title="Delete a specific stash"
git stash drop stash@{<number>}
```

```bash title="Delete all stashes"
git stash drop
```

```bash title="Apply a stash and delete it"
git stash pop
```

```bash title="Apply the most recent stash"
git stash apply
```

```bash title="Apply a specific stash"
git stash apply stash@{<number>}
```

### Branch

It is useful when you want to work on a new feature and test it without affecting the main branch.

```bash title="List all branches"
git branch
```

```bash title="Create a new branch and switch to it"
git checkout -b <name>
```

```bash title="Switch back to the previous local branch you have been working on"
git checkout -
```

```bash title="Rename a branch"
git branch -m <oldName> <newName>
```

```bash title="Delete a branch"
git branch -d <name>
```

```bash title="Add a branch to upstream repository"
git push --set-upstream origin <name>
```

### Stage and commit

Stage is a way to prepare your work for a commit. It allows you to commit your work in smaller parts.

```bash title="Stage all changes"
git add .
```

```bash title="Stage a specific file"
git add <file>
```

```bash title="Unstage all changes"
git reset .
```

```bash title="Commit your work"
git commit -m "your commit message"
```

### Overrides

Overrides are useful when you want to undo your work.

```bash title="Amend a commit message"
git commit --amend
```

```bash title="If you want to keep your work and undo just the last commit"
git reset HEAD~
```

```bash title="If you want to override a file in your local repo with the version in the remote repo"
git reset --hard origin/<current-branch>
```

### Restore previous work

Restore your work if you accidentally deleted it.

```bash title="Undo all uncommitted changes"
git checkout .
```

```bash title="Restore a deleted file"
git checkout HEAD <file>
```

```bash title="Remove last commit by keeping all changes staged"
git reset --soft HEAD~1
```

### Squash commits

First, check the number of commits you want to squash. Then, use that number to tell git how many commits to squash into one:

```bash title="Terminal"
git rev-list HEAD --count
git rebase -i HEAD~<number-of-commits>
```

### Rebase

Bring the changes from the "main" branch to the "staging" branch. Then, push the changes to the existing repository:

```bash title="Terminal"
git checkout staging
git rebase main
git push
```

### Sync feature branch with main branch

If you are in the "feature-branch" and need to pull in the latest changes from the remote main branch:

```bash title="Terminal"
git checkout main
git pull
git checkout feature-branch
git pull --all
git merge main
```

### Rename master branch to main in GitHub

First, make sure to change the name of the branch on GitHub:

```bash title="Go to your GitHub repository"
https://github.com/:username/:repo-name/branches
```

Then, change the name of the branch locally:

```bash title="Terminal"
git branch -m master main
git fetch origin
git branch -u origin/main main
git remote set-head origin -a
```
