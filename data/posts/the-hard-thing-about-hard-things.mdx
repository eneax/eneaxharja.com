While many people talk about how great it is to start a business, Ben Horowitz (co-founder of a16z) offers advice on how to build and run a startup during difficult times.

Favorite quotes from the book:

> There are no shortcuts to knowledge, especially knowledge gained from personal experience. Following conventional wisdom and relying on shortcuts can be worse than knowing nothing at all.

> An early lesson I learned in my career was that whenever a large organization attempts to do anything, it always comes down to a single person who can delay the entire project.

> Note to self: It's a good idea to ask, "What am I not doing?"

> People at McDonald's get trained for their positions, but people with far more complicated jobs don't. It makes no sense.

> The act of judging people in advance will retard their development. If you make a judgment that someone is incapable of doing something such as running a larger organization, will it make sense to teach them those skills or even point out the anticipated deficiencies? Probably not. You've already decided they can't do it.

> Perhaps the most important thing that I learned as an entrepreneur was to focus on what I needed to get right and stop worrying about all the things that I did wrong or might do wrong.

> Embrace the struggle.
