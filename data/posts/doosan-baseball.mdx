Doosan is the global leader in the Infrastructure Support Business and also partner of Major League Baseball.

This project represents my version of the official website.

It's built on Bootstrap 4 and it contains:

- fixed to top navbar,
- jumbotron with a background image,
- the Bootstrapâ€™s grid system,
- contact form with custom Bootstrap form validation messages.

Code available on [GitHub](https://github.com/eneax/doosan-baseball).
