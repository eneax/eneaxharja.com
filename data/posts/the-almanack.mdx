The Almanack is a collection of Naval's wisdom and experience from the last decade, curated by Eric Jorgenson and shared as a compilation of his most insightful interviews and reflections.

Favorite quotes from the book:

> If you have nothing in your life, but you have at least one person that loves you unconditionally, it'll do wonders for your self-esteem.

> Become the best in the world at what you do. Keep redefining what you do until this is true.

> When you find the right thing to do, when you find the right people to work with, invest deeply. Sticking with it for decades is really how you make the big returns in your relationships and in your money.

> No one is going to value you more than you value yourself. You just have to set a very high personal hourly rate and you have to stick to it.

> "Be a maker who makes something interesting people want. Show your craft, practice your craft, and the right people will eventually find you."

> What we wish to be true clouds our perception of what is true. Suffering is the moment when we can no longer deny reality.

> Read what you love until you love to read.

> A calm mind, a fit body, and a house full of love. These things cannot be bought. They must be earned.

> The fundamental delusion: There is something out there that will make me happy and fulfilled forever.

> A personal metric: how much of the day is spent doing things out of obligation rather than out of interest?

> In any situation in life, you always have three choices: you can change it, you can accept it, or you can leave it.

> There is no legacy. There's nothing to leave. We're all going to be gone.

> All that matters is you experience your reality as you go through life. Why not interpret it in the most positive possible way?

> When you really want to change, you just change. But most of us don't really want to change â€” we don't want to go through the pain just yet.

> I think after this life, it's very much like before you were born. Remember that? It's going to be just like that.
