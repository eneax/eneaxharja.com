Yuval Noah Harari traverses the entire human history, from the six human species that inhabited the earth to the only one today. Us. Homo sapiens.

Favorite quotes from the book:

> “You could never convince a monkey to give you a banana by promising him limitless bananas after death in monkey heaven.”

> “How do you cause people to believe in an imagined order such as Christianity, democracy or capitalism? First, you never admit that the order is imagined.”

> “Culture tends to argue that it forbids only that which is unnatural. But from a biological perspective, nothing is unnatural. Whatever is possible is by definition also natural. A truly unnatural behaviour, one that goes against the laws of nature, simply cannot exist, so it would need no prohibition.”
