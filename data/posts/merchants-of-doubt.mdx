Naomi Oreskes and Erik Conway show how ideology and corporate interests, aided by the media, have misled public understanding of some of the most pressing issues of our time, such as DDT, tobacco smoke, acid rain, and global warming.

Favorite quotes from the book:

> “While the idea of equal time for opposing opinions makes sense in a two-party political system, it does not work for science, because science is not about opinion. It is about evidence.”

> “The industry had realized you could create the impression of controversy simply by asking questions”
