Jon Ronson investigates psychopaths and the industry of doctors, scientists, and everyone else who studies them.

Favorite quote from the book:

> “There is no evidence that we've been placed on this planet to be especially happy or especially normal. And in fact our unhappiness and our strangeness, our anxieties and compulsions, those least fashionable aspects of our personalities, are quite often what lead us to do rather interesting things.”
