Deep Work is Cal Newport's guide to anyone seeking focused success in a distracted world.

Favorite quotes from the book:

> “If you don't produce, you won't thrive — no matter how skilled or talented you are.”

> “Clarity about what matters provides clarity about what does not.”

> “Who you are, what you think, feel, and do, what you love — is the sum of what you focus on.”
