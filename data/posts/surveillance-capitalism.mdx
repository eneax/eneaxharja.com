Shoshana Zuboff shows that we are at a crossroads: allow technology to enrich the few and impoverish the many, or harness it and distribute its benefits.

Favorite quote from the book:

> “Surveillance capitalism unilaterally claims human experience as free raw material for translation into behavioral data.”
