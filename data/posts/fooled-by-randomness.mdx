Nassim Nicholas Taleb investigates of opacity, luck, uncertainty, probability, human error, risk, and decision-making in a world we don't understand.

Favorite quotes from the book:

> “Heroes are heroes because they are heroic in behavior, not because they won or lost.”

> “Probability is not a mere computation of odds on the dice or more complicated variants; it is the acceptance of the lack of certainty in our knowledge and the development of methods for dealing with our ignorance.”
