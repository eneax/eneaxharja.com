John Green tells the story of Aza Holmes, a young woman navigating daily existence within the ever-tightening spiral of her own thoughts.

Favorite quotes from the book:

> “Your now is not your forever.”

> “We never really talked much or even looked at each other, but it didn't matter because we were looking at the same sky together, which is maybe even more intimate than eye contact anyway. I mean, anybody can look at you. It's quite rare to find someone who sees the same world you see.”

> “You're both the fire and the water that extinguishes it. You're the narrator, the protagonist, and the sidekick. You're the storyteller and the story told. You are somebody's something, but you are also your you.”

> “The thing about a spiral is, if you follow it inward, it never actually ends. It just keeps tightening, infinitely.”

> “The problem with happy endings is that they're either not really happy, or not really endings, you know? In real life, some things get better and some things get worse. And then eventually you die.”
